## The Psyche-C Project

Psyche-C is a rather unique compiler frontend for the C programming language. The primary goal Psyche-C is to support the implementation of static analysis tools, but it may also be used as an ordinary parser through the *cnippet* driver adaptor. A brief summary of the capabilities of Psyche-C is available in the [project's frontpage README](https://github.com/ltcmelo/psychec/blob/master/README.md).

All of the resources and documentation about Psyche-C may be found in its [open source code repository](https://github.com/ltcmelo/psychec), except for those related to its distinguished type inference engine, which are described here.
