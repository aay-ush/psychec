## The Psyche-C Project

Psyche-C is a rather unique compiler frontend for the C programming language. The capabilities of Psyche-C that make it "special" are described in the [project's README](https://github.com/ltcmelo/psychec/blob/master/README.md).

The primary goal of Psyche-C is to support the implementation of static analysis tools, but it may also be used as an ordinary parser through the [*cnippet* driver adaptor](https://github.com/ltcmelo/psychec/#the-cnippet-driver-adaptor).

Resources and documentation about Psyche-C may be found in its [open source repository](https://github.com/ltcmelo/psychec), except for those related to its distinguished type inference engine, which are the reason for this website.
